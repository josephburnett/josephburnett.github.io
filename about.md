This is my personal website where I share my hobbies of [photography][1], [coding][git] and [writing][3].

My [photography portfolio][1] includes images from the [Old City of Jerusalem][jer], the mountains of [Ladakh][lad] and the vineyards of [Chile][chi].  I enjoy [macro photography][mac] and the occasional [portraiture][por].  I'm currently shooting with a Canon 7D and an 18-250 Sigma zoom lens, but I also use a Canon 10D with 20mm, 50mm and 100mm prime lenses.

I am a professional programmer and I enjoy hacking in my spare time too.  My [Github page][git] has some of my side projects such as [Mash Commander][mash] (the command-line shell for kids) and [Hive-Jam][jam] (a loop-oriented, multi-player framework for making music with Sonic Pi).  I'm currently working for Google Cloud building [serverless computing products][cloud].  At work I use Java, Python and Go.  At home I write mostly Clojure and Go.

I've started a [weblog][3]  to share my thoughts on software development, mindfulness and general human behavior.  You can follow in the [Fediverse][fed] at [@jb@josephburnett.social][jb].
