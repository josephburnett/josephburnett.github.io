This is my personal website where I share my hobbies of [photography][1], [coding][2] and [writing][3].

The [photography page][1] recounts my travels to places like streets of [Jerusalem][jer], the mountains of [Ladakh][lad] and the vineyards of [Chile][chi].  I also enjoy [macro photography][mac] on a rainy day and occasional [portraiture][por].  I'm currently shooting with a Canon 7D and an 18-250 Sigma zoom lens, but I also use a Canon 10D with 20mm, 50mm and 100mm prime lenses.

I'm a professional programmer and I enjoy hacking in my spare time too.  My [coding page][2] has a few snippets, most of which are publicly available on [my Github profile][git].  I'm currently working for AWS building a marketplace for selling software and services running in the EC2 cloud, writing Java and Ruby.  At home I write mostly Clojure and Perl.

I've also started a [weblog][3] under which to share my thoughts on software development, mindfulness and general human behavior.
