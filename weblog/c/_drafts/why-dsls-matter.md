Writing and coding creatively the same process -- a process of drafting and revision; of seeking clarity for our readers and for our own thoughts.

>"Have something to say.  Say it as clearly as possible."

When writing computer code, the idea is first and foremost.  There is some need and you have an idea about how to meet it.  There is a thing that you want to do which you must express to the computer correctly.  But you must also be clear in your mind what the mean -- the semantics -- of your solution is.  And you must be clear in communicating your idea to your fellow programmer and your future self in the source code of your writing.  It is not sufficient to have something that works.  It must also be expressed clearly.

What does it mean to express something clearly in source code?  Well, first of all, you must know your reader.  The context in which your code will be executing is important.  Many of the strategies for clarity in writing apply also to programming, such as perferring shorter words to longer words.  In programming there are some paradigms of style that help the reader to understand the meaning of the code.  Such as a declarative style in which the programmer makes a series of statements about what things are and what is true.

Programming in a functional style prefers building small ideas which will always be true because side-effects are not allowed.  And then building the bigger idea from smaller ones.  This is a style more like a mathematical proof.  Sometimes good for you audience, somes not.

But expressing your idea to a human reader is only part of the need for clarity.  Most importantly clarity of writing brings clarity of thought.

Can it be done?

>"Anything that can be though can be though clearly.  Anything that can be written can be written clearly."

I say anything that can be coded can be coded clearly.  Call it the Turing completeness of clarity.
