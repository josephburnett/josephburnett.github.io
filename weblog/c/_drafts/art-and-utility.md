title: "The Art and Utility of Programming"

I recently had a discussion at work about the utility created by programming.  My friend said that he would love to strip from the programmer the notion that a program had to be perfect and clean to be good.  Good engineering, he said, is about keeping a vision but building what provides the most value for the business.  Even if it's ugly.  Time to market is huge.

Every engineer has a desire to make their code clean.  Beautiful.  Correct.  This drive for perfection is indeed at odds with the best interest of the business, at least on the surface.  But I think there's more to this impulse than just naivety, desire for control or some form of OCD.  Creating software is art.  And it is experienced through reading and maintaining the source code in symbiosis with running the software.  If the output of the program was all that mattered, the source code wouldn't make any different to the experience of using the software.  But it does.

The origins of art are in the use of everyday objects.  A pitcher for water.  Clothing for the body.  And the experience of that art comes from the practical use of the object as well as the appreciation for its construction.  A piece of software whose source code you never see is the pitcher that pours your water while you aren't looking.  You get the utility of the object, but not the experience.

Stripping the notion of code perfection from the software developer is like taking the art out of everyday objects.  The utility is still there but the world becomes formless.  There is no art to inspire new art.  There is no experience to be had in reading something you like or dislike.  Nothing speaks to you.  There is only code that does the job.  A formless, mechanical work, devoid of art.

I get where my friend was coming from.  Engineers have a tendency to overly focus on their act of creation instead of the way the object will affect the world.  Practicality is required to make the world turn.  Creation of an object must solve a problem, except in the most esoteric of circumstance.

My friend said that what differentiated a good engineer from a great one is the ability to see the greater picture.  To see the utility of the software toward building a business.  To focus on what the thing does, not what it is.  It's about maturing as a developer.  But growth in the opposite direction is also important.  To be able to create a more beautiful object required practice.  A mature developer's code should just "look good".  It should be pleasant to work with.

I see the worlds of the company and the artist as being mostly overlapping.  Beautiful things are usually useful.  And well made things are usually good looking.  The overlap of these areas is a no-brainer.  But being comfortable stepping outside the overlap, into the world of pure utility or the realm of art, are skills equally important to becoming a mature engineer.  And a happy one too.
