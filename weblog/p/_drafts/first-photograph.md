When I take a series of photographs, it seems the first one is usually the best.

I think it's because what draws my attention to a particular frame is a System 1 signal.  It's an impulse that I willing act on by snapping a photo.  But then I try and decompose that impulse to understand why I liked that juxtaposition.  I want to recreate the conditions that created that impulse so that I can control and enhance it.  But I don't create that same natural feeling.
