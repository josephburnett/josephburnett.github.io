Why should I bother writing when I could be *doing*?  Hammering out a prototype.  Writing code.  Building something.  Why wait?  Well, I've noticed that my best and most useful ideas come from a systematic and thoughtful deconstruction of a problem.  And the thread of that process is written down.

Not only does writing clarify my thought process, but it also makes the end product more understandable.  In code, more understandable equates to fewer bugs and easier maintenance.

I really like Leslie Lamport's assertion that true thinking requires writing.  And writing requires practice.  So I've resolved to practice writing more regularly, of which this is the first instance.
