>"[English] becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts."

In [George Orwell's 1946 essay][1], "Politics and the English Language", he encourages the use of precise and detailed prose to combat, not only the degradation of the English language, but of our thoughts.

Once again, ["in order to think you have to write"][2].
