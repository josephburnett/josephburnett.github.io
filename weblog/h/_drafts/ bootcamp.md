The experience of having a newborn recalls the experience of Marine boot camp.  Both are endeavors which, after enlistment, launched my life on an irrevocable change of course.  Both are *way* more challenging and rewarding than I imagined at the start.

At the outset all privilege and free-will are revoked in a haze of screaming and sleep deprivation -- although I would take the raspy bellow of a Drill Sergeant over the urgent cries of a newborn any day.  In my attempts to sooth our baby I move my body in new ways, bouncing for hours on an exercise ball, just to get him to go to sleep. 

Slowly over time freedom is restored to those that persevere.
