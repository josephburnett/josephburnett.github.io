Kids are adults in training. But some stuff is hard to get them to
practice, like chores and managing their money. It's easier to do it
for them and buy them stuff when they ask for it.  There is no easy
answer, but through trial and error we have found a pretty good
process. It's called "family meeting".

There are equal parts fun and work. The agenda is the same every week:

1. refreshments
2. weekly schedule
3. meal planning
4. jobs
5. issues and celebrations
6. allowance
7. game

Refreshments are something tasty to eat or drink. It gets everyone to
the table but no one can start until every one is present.

While everyone is enjoying their refreshments, we go over the schedule
for the week. Things like play dates, doctors appointments, or
anything unusual to be prepared for.

Meal planning is also for the week. Every one gets down a cookbook or
two and proposes a meal. They can help make it or not.

Jobs are divided into categories of daily, weekly, monthly, and
quarterly. The daily jobs are always the same:

1. vacuum the entryway and under the table
2. wipe down the bathroom sinks and mirrors
3. wipe down the toilets
4. empty the dishwasher

Everyone gets a daily job. The weekly jobs are also the same every
week:

1. vacuum the whole house
2. clean the tub and shower
3. mop the kitchen and bathrooms
4. dust the house and clean the microwave

Monthly and quarterly jobs are arranged in a rotation so individual
jobs come up at the right interval. Each person is assigned a monthly
/ quarterly each week. So all together, each person gets three jobs
each week: one daily, one weeky, and one monthly / quarterly.

We do the daily every couple days and it take 5-10 minutes. Every
Sunday morning we spend one hour doing the other two. There is still a
lot of parental help with the jobs but the kids are slowly getting
more independent and effective.

After jobs we do issues and celebrations. Anyone can bring up
something they see as a problem, something they want to change, or
something exciting they want to celebrate. For example, to
congratulate a kid on a good report from school. It is also when they
can express problems, propose solutions, and even make changes to
family meeting itself.

Then we give the kids their allowance. It's currently 12 PLN per week
(about 3 dollars) and they place it into three buckets:

1. spend
2. save
3. share

Spend can be used whenever for whatever, like Kinder eggs, tictacs,
etc... Save is for a specific goal. The goal can only be changed at
family meeting, but it can still be anything. They cannot change their
save goal in the shop when they see something then want. Share is also
for a goal, but for someone else, like the WWF, refugees, etc... The
12 PLN can be distributed into any of the buckets, however they must
put at least 2 PLN minimum in each bucket.

Finally we play a board game or build lego together for about 20-30
minutes. The whole family meeting process takes about one hour.

We didn't introduce this all at once. It's developed over several
years as we've added jobs and responsibilities and increased
allowance. We've swapped things out, like the daily jobs. One kid
suggested a new agenda item "5.1 goals" which they run each week. They
ask each person what their personal goal is for the week and how they
did the week before. Changing the details of family meeting during
issues / celebrations gives the kids some agency. And having a
designated time for issues allows us to defer discussions when
necessary. E.g. instead of talking about who owns a particular toy
during bedtime routines, we say "let's talk about that at family
meeting."  Most importantly, the kids WANT to have family meeting so
we have a framework and space for coming together to talk about issues
even as they get older.
