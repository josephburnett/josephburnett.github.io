There is a shadow world flowing through all that surrounds us. It is a
world of numbers and symbols, possibility and computation.  Every
touch, every perception, every word is an atom in the landscape
beneath our shared hallucination that is reality.

When we engage mathematics and computation we directly address this
shadow world, reaching beneath the surface to control the world at
large. It is indirect, wrong and effective. It our only means of
projecting ourselves beyond ourselves.

Even the self is a collection of statistical models, competing for the
floating point of attention. Everything we know is a temporal
projection of data, the result of past computation. Every thought is
the application of a function to transform ourselves into a new
state. We are more analog that the digital computers we create. But
they reflect our underlying nature; they are part of the same shadow
world as our natural perceptions.

Studying computer languages reveals aspects of the natural world. The
computation models we create reflect our nature as concious
beings. The study of lambda calculus or turing machines is the study
movement in the shadow world that encompases all human minds. Whether
we study the wings of bees or the domain of continuations, we learn
something about ourselves and world around us.
