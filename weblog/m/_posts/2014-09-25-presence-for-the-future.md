> "It is the quality of your consciousness at this moment that determines the future."

> -- Eckhart Tolle

Tolle is talking about *presence*.  When our entire focus is on the future or the past, we are not living in the moment.  The future is a construct of our mind--only the present moment truly exists.  Only in the present moment can we take action.  

Likewise, the past is relevant only as a guide for our actions in the moment.  When it is no longer relevant we must let it go.

When we view the present through the lens of the future or past, our lives are full of problems.  But problems don't exist.  Only situations exist, right now.  The future and past are a distorted view of what *is*.

> When you are full of problems, there is no room for anything new to enter, no room for a solution.

When we focus on what *is* we are embracing forgiveness, acceptance and compassion.

Forget about the past.  Put the future out of your mind.  There will plenty of time to attend to it when the moment comes.  Open your eyes and look around at what *is*.
