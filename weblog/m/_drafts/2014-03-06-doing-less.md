The other day a friend at work asked me "How do you do so much?".  He made a similar comment in my annual peer feedback, that he has no idea how I find the time for all that I do.  Immediately I observed myself thinking, "Oh my god.  I can't get anything done!" -- a familiar phrase uttered while staring into the abyss of things-to-do.  I could put all my time in there and I still wouldn't make a dent!

I wanted to give an honest, concise answer.  So I said "Stop.  Do less.  Let yourself have the space to see what's most important to spend your time on."  Do less.  That probably sounded like a bullshit answer, but it's the most honest one I could give.

I don't really _do_ that much.  So what is this guy talking about?  Somehow he's gotten the impression that I'm _doing_ a lot.  Or maybe the things that I'm doing are getting his attention.  On a good day I spend my time intentionally doing the things that are most important toward my goals and my values.  So maybe I'm getting a lot of bang for my buck.

On a really good day I go home thinking, "Man, I really made a difference today!"  And those days almost always start out with 15 minutes of meditation and are broken up with copious coffee breaks and walks from one place to another.  I spend my day deciding what to do each minute, not reacting to things that come up.  Or reacting to thoughts about what I should be doing or cannot do.  In other words, I spend a lot of time _being_.  Just hanging out with my thoughts, watching them come and go until I see something that's worth taking action on.  I'm driven by value-based decisions.

Some of my most impactful work has been done in defiance of a laundry list of things to do.  Here is a great big list.  And I'm not going to do any of those things.  I'm going to do what I want to which this this thing.  Sometimes that's procrastination.  But often it's a subtle signal that there are opportunities to be had.  I even replaced my todo list with an "opportunity" list which I would browse like an restaurant menu at the beginning of the day.  Can't do everything, so may as well do something I like.

I'm flattered that my friend thinks that I do a lot.  But he's mistaken.  The thinks he notices are the result of doing less.  And spending more time being with my own thoughts.  Without reaction.  Without judgement.  It sounds counterintuitive.  It sounds like a bullshit answer.  Do less.  But that's the best I've got.
