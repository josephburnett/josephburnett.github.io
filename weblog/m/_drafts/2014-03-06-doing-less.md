title: "Do Less"

The other day a friend at work asked me "How do you do so much?".  He made a similar comment in my annual peer feedback, that he has no idea how I find the time for all that I do.  Immediately I observed myself thinking, "Oh my god.  I can't get anything done!" -- a familiar phrase uttered while staring into the abyss of things-to-do.  I could put all my time in there and I still wouldn't make a dent!

I wanted to give an honest, concise answer.  So I said "Stop.  Do less.  Let yourself have the space to see what's most important to spend your time on."  Do less.  That probably sounded like a bullshit answer, but it's the most honest one I could give.

I don't really _do_ that much.  So what is this guy talking about?  Somehow he's gotten the impression that I'm _doing_ a lot.  Or maybe the things that I'm doing are getting his attention.  On a good day I spend my time intentionally doing the things that are most important toward my goals and my values.  So maybe I'm getting a lot of bang for my buck.

The goal of meditation is to enhance the gap between impulse and action.  The mind is a survival machine and it has a significant negative bias.  Its purpose is to think of all the things that can go wrong and control them.  Our thoughts are words--clips and phrases, often repeated and usually negative.  When we react impulsively to our thoughts, we identify with our mind.  There is no opportunity to see our thoughts as anything but ourselves.  And no chance to disconnect from them.

But something interesting happens when we slow down and stop reacting to our thoughts.  We discover that our thoughts are not our entire selves.  There is something else, the observer, which can watch thoughts and emotions come and go like clouds in the sky.  There is another, higher self.  The ability to inject a gap between thoughts and actions is a skill that can be developed.  And the practice of developing that skill is called meditation.  It's the act of _being_ without _doing_.

Work tends to generate many negative thoughts.  Some are worth of action and some are not.  Most thoughts are about the future or the past.  They are about changing the way that things are now.  I need to do this thing.  Or that thing.  And there is an negative implication to such phrases, the or-else.  Or else I won't finish my work on time.  Or else I won't get a good review.  Or else I will lose my job.

When we fully identify with our minds ....  That doesn't sound so bad at first, to be immersed in and controlled by your thoughts.  But the catch is that our emotions can snap our attention to

On a really good day I go home thinking, "Man, I really made a difference today!"  And those days almost always start out with 15 minutes of meditation and are broken up with copious coffee breaks and walks from one place to another.  I spend my day deciding what to do each minute, not reacting to things that come up.  Or reacting to thoughts about what I should be doing or cannot do.  In other words, I spend a lot of time _being_.  Just hanging out with my thoughts, watching them come and go until I see something that's worth taking action on.  I'm driven by value-based decisions.

Some of my most impactful work has been done in defiance of a laundry list of things to do.  Here is a great big list.  And I'm not going to do any of those things.  I'm going to do what I want to which this this thing.  Sometimes that's procrastination.  But often it's a subtle signal that there are opportunities to be had.  I even replaced my todo list with an "opportunity" list which I would browse like an restaurant menu at the beginning of the day.  Can't do everything, so may as well do something I like.

I'm flattered that my friend thinks that I do a lot.  But he's mistaken.  The thinks he notices are the result of doing less.  And spending more time being with my own thoughts.  Without reaction.  Without judgement.  It sounds counterintuitive.  It sounds like a bullshit answer.  Do less.  But that's the best I've got.
